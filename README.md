# UnityTerrainAdder
This is a script that will allow you to generate as many terrain tiles in Unity as you want.
If you're anything like me, you may find yourself wanting to generate a lot of land but are too lazy to do it yourself. Fear not I built a script that will allow you to do so and move onto other things that you want to do.
There are a couple of things that should be mentioned. The first is that while the program is in use you can't use the mouse because Pyautogui is using it instead. Second make sure you are being careful and understanding your memory allocation in Unity, if you can't manage it effectively your program will slow down and even freeze up. 
I've also added a mouse location file, this isn't mine it's from the pyautogui site but I figured I'd save you some time because it becomes a really useful tool.
